# Portfolio

## My 1st portfolio during Bootcamp

### What you will see

Since it's still in dev stage, changes will be made to look more professional in time.

I have 3 pages, Landing, about & a portfolio section
- Landing: simple color combo and with additional content i plan on adding more JS to the code.

- About: Simple bio with a profile photo.

- Portfolio: Will be the meat of the site. I will be adding more projects with more JS to display different projects. 

### Tech Used

HTML, CSS, minimal JS but with additional content more features will be added. 

Responsive for 3 size viewports.
